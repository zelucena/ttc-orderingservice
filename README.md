## BFT ordering service for Hyperledger Fabric v1.3

This is a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service for Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) v1.3. This BFT ordering service is a wrapper around [BFT-SMaRt](https://github.com/bft-smart/library), a Java open source BFT library maintained by the LaSIGE research unit at the University of Lisbon. 

To get started, check out the [overview page](https://github.com/bft-smart/fabric-orderingservice/wiki/Overview) and our [quick start guide](https://github.com/bft-smart/fabric-orderingservice/wiki/Quick-Start-v1.3). You can also [learn to compile the code](https://github.com/bft-smart/fabric-orderingservice/wiki/Compiling). For a more in-dept look at how to configure a distributed deployment with this ordering service, you can [read our guide](https://github.com/bft-smart/fabric-orderingservice/wiki/Configuring-a-deployment-v1.3). For an in-depth look at the ordering service architecture and performance, check out the [DSN'18 paper](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~bessani/publications/dsn18-hlfsmart.pdf).
